# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please use a private disclosure channel for security reports. Do not use public trackers for security problems.

Include:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant configuration or environment details

## Supported versions
The supported version is v1.0.0.

## Security notes
- High-risk tools are disabled by default and require explicit enablement.
- No request headers or bodies are logged by default.
- Outbound tools rely on allowlists and size limits to reduce abuse risk.
